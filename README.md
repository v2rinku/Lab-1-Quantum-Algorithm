## üöÄ What You Will Learn

This lab introduces both **basic** and **intermediate** quantum algorithms that leverage the power of quantum mechanics. By the end of the lab, you will have practical experience coding quantum algorithms in Python using the **Qiskit framework**.

### üß† Topics Covered:

---

### **Basic Quantum Algorithms**

1. **Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG)**
   Explore how quantum mechanics can be used to generate truly random numbers. In this section, you will learn about the inherent randomness in quantum systems and how it differs from classical random number generation.
